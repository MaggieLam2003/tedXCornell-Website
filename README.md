# TedxCornell

## Description 
TedxCornell is a website created for a club on campus called, you guessed it, TedxCornell. TedxCornell is a "an independently organized TEDx event dedicated to promoting the exchange of groundbreaking ideas, fostering intellectual curiosity, and inspiring positive change within the Cornell University community and beyond". 

The website is mobile friendly and contains functionality like an accordion, drop-down menu, and hamburger menu. This was a group coordinated project that had the focus of uplifting one of the many organizations on campus.
